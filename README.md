# Lagrange Multipliers
---
Solving two optimization problems using Lagrange Multipliers.

Consider the point \math-container{M\index{1} }belonging to the parabola of equation \math-container{y = x\power{2}} and the point \math-container{M\index{2} }belonging to the parabola of equation \math-container{y = -(x-4)\power{4} -2}. We wish to determine the coordinates of the points \math-container{M\index{1}} and \math-container{M\index{2}} so as to minimize the distance between \math-container{M\index{1} }and \math-container{M\index{2}}.
