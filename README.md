Solving two optimization problems using Lagrange Multipliers.

# Problem 1

Consider the point M1 belonging to the parabola of equation y = x^2 and the point M2 belonging to the parabola of equation y = -(x-4)^2 -2 . We wish to determine the coordinates of the points M1 and M2 so as to minimize the distance between them.

# Problem 2
Consider the function J(x).  We wish to implement the method of the gradient with optimal learning rate alpha to determine the minimum of this function.
